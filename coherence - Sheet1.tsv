2020_MLa_281_2.docx	Argument	"The more common and peaceful example of uselessness of sports is just asking ""what did i benefit from it?""."	H	H	L	H	H
2020_MLa_281_2.docx	Elaboration	 Because, it's also very common nowadays that people just watching TV drinking beer and eating crisps and it continues for a long time.	H	H	L	1. L, 2. L	L

2020_MLa_384_2.docx	Argument	First of all, lots of people, especially men, like watching sport channels sitting on the sofa, while their wifes doing their chores.					H

L
2020_MLa_399_2.docx	Elaboration	So, such people are going to sports events to become more closely to their dreams.					H
2020_MLa_399_2.docx	Elaboration	I am convinced that watching and visiting sports matches can motivate some children or even adults to become professional sportsmen or start a healthy lifestyle.					H
2020_MLa_399_2.docx	Argument	What is more, for some part of people it is a kind of relaxing after a hard working day, or a thing that they do to meet with their friends.					L
2020_MLa_399_2.docx	Elaboration	 For instance, we with my five friends go to my room and watch football matches every Sunday at 9 pm o'clock.					H

2020_MLa_399_2.docx	Elaboration	 There is no doubt that they do not spend their time irrationally, because they write articles, make videos or even documental films about mathes they visit.					H

2020_MLa_39_2.docx	Argument	The main reason why I agree is that (DS) you spend your time watching the TV (or attending the live event) instead of (DS) improving yourself in your field of knowledge.					H
2020_MLa_39_2.docx	Argument	As a (DS) student, I know how important it is to properly manage your time schedule.					L

2020_MLa_401_2.docx	Elaboration	It can be just on the background.					L
2020_MLa_401_2.docx	Elaboration	Moreover, sports show can go while meeting with friends.					L
2020_MLa_401_2.docx	Elaboration	Whatching sports shows in the background is better than music, because you can see the results of the match in real time, and you do not need completely distracted by the match.					H
2020_MLa_401_2.docx	Elaboration	This is ideal way for a fan.					L
2020_MLa_401_2.docx	Argument	Another reason for my position is that whatching sports can give you energy and positive charge by seeing team spirit and desire to go all the way.					L

2020_MLa_402_2.docx	Introductory material	Nowadays watching sports is quite a popular hobby, many people engoy it very much.					H
2020_MLa_402_2.docx	Thesis	However, there is an opinion that this hobby is useless, no matter watching it on TV or going to see it in real life.					H
2020_MLa_402_2.docx	Thesis	I absolutely agree with this opinion because of health and time-management aspects.					L
2020_MLa_402_2.docx	Argument	Firstly, sports events happen really often, almost every day, consequently, a person usually spends plenty of time sitting on one place and probably eating junk food.					L
2020_MLa_402_2.docx	Elaboration	This way of spending free time is not healthy at all, even if not harmful.					H
2020_MLa_402_2.docx	Elaboration	There are many other ways to have a rest and relax.					L
2020_MLa_402_2.docx	Elaboration	For examle, that person instead of watching could go and do sports by him- or herself, instead of watching football go out and play it.					L
2020_MLa_402_2.docx	Argument	Secondly, watching sports is not like watching a film, because a person need to stay focused on a picture otherwise he or she probably would not understand anything.					H
2020_MLa_402_2.docx	Elaboration	For example, talking about films it will be fair to say that you can just listen to film and it can be enough to understand everything.					H
2020_MLa_402_2.docx	Elaboration	"So, somebody can do something good like cleaning while ""watching"" a film."					L

2020_MLa_403_2.docx	Thesis	Some people are convinced that watching sport events is a wasteful and uselesss method to spend a day.					H
2020_MLa_403_2.docx	Thesis	I agree with this opinion as there are another occupationg that can be realized successfully.					L
2020_MLa_403_2.docx	Irrelevant	Besides, this deal is extremely life consuming.					L
2020_MLa_403_2.docx	Argument	Firstly, this occupation is deceptive as it gives misleading sense that the one is doing sports.					L
2020_MLa_403_2.docx	Elaboration	This position can be destructive as a person has to understand that it is better to do sports instead of watching it in a stable position.					H
2020_MLa_403_2.docx	Argument	Furthermore, the program takes the same amount as a good training.					L
2020_MLa_403_2.docx	Elaboration	That is why, it is better to stimulate you organism while training instead of watching it at home or even in a special event building where a tictet is required.					H
2020_MLa_403_2.docx	Argument	Secondly, watching sports can be expensive and time consuming.					H
2020_MLa_403_2.docx	Elaboration	There is a great amount of subscription that give a person the ability to visit every local game of the loved group.					L
2020_MLa_403_2.docx	Elaboration	From this point, it means that a person can visit more that ten events throughout a season.					L
2020_MLa_403_2.docx	Elaboration	"That is why, this person will not ""lose a chance"" to surport admirable group, which will take free time that could be spent on personal life, mental health and phisical health."					L
2020_MLa_403_2.docx	Argument	Thirdly, this engagement is slitely underestimated: the one has to prepare himself for the game, buy a tictet to go for the event, find a partner for the evening and allocate time for queue and other nuisanses.					L
2020_MLa_403_2.docx	Elaboration	This cannot be a relaxing way of spending a time.					L
2020_MLa_403_2.docx	Elaboration	In other words, it is better to find another occupation like meditation or doing sports thta is not that comsuming and nervous.					H
2020_MLa_403_2.docx	Conclusion	To sum up, watching sports cannot be a helpful and agreeable way to spend free time as it requires nice budget, tons of unnecessary time and it cannot replace training that shoul be in everyone's schedule.					H

2020_MLa_86_2.docx	Thesis	 Personnaly, I'm not really keen on sport at the moment.					H
2020_MLa_86_2.docx	Elaboration	In my younger days we used to gather all the family members together in one room in front of the TV and watch the football match of the team we were all supporting.					L
2020_MLa_86_2.docx	Elaboration	Inevitably, when you grow up the lack of time resourse problem becomes crutial and you have to choose what should you spend it on.					L
2020_MLa_86_2.docx	Argument	It would definetely be a mistake of mine if I call watching sports a 'waste' of time, because considering the others opinion is obviously not less important.					L
2020_MLa_86_2.docx	Elaboration	In my case there simply are different time-spending priorities, such as work, studying, rest etc.					L
2020_MLa_86_2.docx	Argument	Watching sports could surely be identified as a type of 'rest', however it works individually and is not my peace of cake, to be honest.					H
2020_MLa_86_2.docx	Elaboration	As the most genuine example, I would prefer sleeping or watching a calm film to have the real rest from the everyday life boiling with emotions and actions than have another portion of adrenaline from a sport event.					H
2020_MLa_86_2.docx	Conclusion	In conclusion, there is no clear view on the topic globally, because of the amount of opinions and people who find watching sports a distraction or a way to have some rest with colleagues and friends can't be judjed.					H
2020_MLa_86_2.docx	Conclusion	As for me, watching a sport event can't be comparised with the other things I find useful to spend time on, that is why I don't watch sports at all.					H
2020_MLa_87_2.docx	Argument	To begin with, I want to suppose why people do not like watching sports.					H

2020_MLa_87_2.docx	Elaboration	Meanwhile typical image of person watching sports on TV or on a stadium is something like a couch potato, a very reluctant person who can not play sports himself and watch it.					H
2020_MLa_87_2.docx	Elaboration	Most of the sport events are noisy and crowdy, there is a lot of interaction between people even watching it not live, which basically does not fit into lives of introverts, for example.					H
2020_MLa_87_2.docx	Argument	Nevertheless, I do not support this opinion.					L
2020_MLa_87_2.docx	Elaboration	Watching sport might be productive, and I would like to explain why.					L
2020_MLa_87_2.docx	Elaboration	Firstly, you have the opportunity to earn money while watching your favorite game.					H
2020_MLa_87_2.docx	Elaboration	I am not meaning any gambling by that, for instance there is a Fantasy League in football, where you analyse the data from matchdays and you may make your own predicitions without losing any money.					H
2020_MLa_87_2.docx	Argument	Secondly, watching sports helps you to be more patient and pay attention to details.					L
2020_MLa_87_2.docx	Elaboration	As I have already said, all kinds of sports include different analitics processes, and from that you may learn basic tactics almost like on a crash course.					L

2020_MLa_88_2.docx	Elaboration	During the time we watch sports games, we gain knowledge more quickly, therefore it is a better way to understand the rules than just hearing about them.					H
2020_MLa_88_2.docx	Argument	Also one can get motivation from his or hers favourite sports idols and get a boost in developing own characteristics: starting to eat more healthy or doing more exercises.					L
